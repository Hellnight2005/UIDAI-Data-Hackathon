Data Exploration Report — UIDAI Data Hackathon
1️⃣ Environment Setup

The first step in any data project is setting up a proper environment.

Python 3.12 was installed on the system.

Jupyter Notebook was installed to provide an interactive workspace for coding, analysis, and visualization.

Jupyter Notebook allows combining code, results, and explanations in a single document, making it ideal for team collaboration.

2️⃣ Dataset Loading

The dataset was stored in a specific folder on the system.

From the multiple files in the dataset folder, only one CSV file (demographics.csv) was selected for analysis.

Loading the correct dataset ensures the analysis focuses on relevant data and avoids redundancy.

Checking the path and verifying the existence of the dataset prevents runtime errors when reading the data.

3️⃣ Initial Data Exploration

Once the dataset was loaded, initial exploration was performed to understand its structure:

Columns: Identifying all the columns helped understand what data attributes are available.

First few rows: Inspecting the first few rows provides an overview of the data values, formatting, and general quality.

Missing values: Checking for missing values ensures data completeness and identifies columns that may need cleaning.

Data types: Understanding whether a column is numeric, categorical, or textual guides further analysis and appropriate preprocessing steps.

Summary statistics: Numeric columns were analyzed to observe minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation values, which help in detecting outliers or anomalies.

4️⃣ Displaying Full Data

For small datasets, displaying all rows and columns is useful to manually inspect each record.

This helps identify errors, inconsistencies, or unusual patterns that might not be visible in truncated views.

It is particularly helpful for categorical and textual columns where individual values matter.

5️⃣ Unique Values per Column

Analyzing unique values provides insights into the variability of data in each column:

Categorical columns: Counting unique values shows how many categories exist (e.g., gender might have 2 categories: male and female).

Numeric columns: Counting unique values helps detect repeated data or potential IDs.

Missing values: Knowing missing counts alongside unique values allows for better decisions on data cleaning.

This step is essential for understanding data distribution and planning preprocessing or feature engineering.
