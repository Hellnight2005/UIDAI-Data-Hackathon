Step 1: Dropping the state and district column since it has no use

Step 2: Calculating the important values 
Aggregating the value by pincode and adding both the biometric values

Insight 1 : Which pincode generate the most biometric 
Analysis of top 10 biometric active pincodes shows strong geographic concentration of demand. Children aged 5-17 contribute to majority of biometric transaction in most high volume areas, with child share exceeding 60% in several pincodes. A smaller subset of pincodes is adult dominated , likely reflecting employement or migration patterns. These finding highlights the need for targeted operational planning and age specific service stratergies.

Insight 2 : Age-group dominance per pincode 



Insight 3: Unusual pincodes
Insight 4: Time trends
Insight 5: Child-heavy v/s adult heavy regions
Insight 6: Coorelation between age groups 
Insight 7: Rank pincode by efficiency




Things to do :
1. Improve readabililty of data
2. Compare age groups properly
3. Aggregrate the data
4. Trend over time
5. Outlier Detection
6. Statistical analysis

By Biometric data i can get an rough idea of how much dense population is there in a particular region 
also the birth rate population
